# IA Letter C Detector

This project implements a **simple perceptron** to detect whether a 25-pixel image contains the letter **C** or not. The goal is to demonstrate the basics of supervised learning and the use of perceptrons for binary classification tasks.

## Features

- **Letter C detection**: The perceptron takes a 25-pixel image (represented as a vector) and determines whether the image corresponds to the letter "C" or not.
- **Training and prediction**: The model is trained on a labeled dataset and can predict the presence of the letter C in new images.
- **Visualization**: You can easily test with different images and observe the model's learning process.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- **`perceptron.py`**: Implementation of the perceptron and training logic.
- **`sandbox.py`**: A test file to experiment with the model and input data.
- **`README.md`**: This file containing the project documentation.

## Reference
The perceptron and learning algorithms used in this project are based on concepts discussed in **Yann LeCun's** book **`Deep Learning`**. If you want to learn more about neural networks, perceptrons, and deep learning, I highly recommend reading it.
